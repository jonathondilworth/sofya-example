&lt;p&gt;The name Sofya is the Russian form of the Greek Sophia, meaning wisdom. It seemed like an apt name for a blogging theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having browsed through a bunch of different themes that were available for free online, I failed to find one that encompassed all of the design elements that I wanted. In addition, I had been meaning to start a little bit more design-orientated work in my free time as I spend most of my time working on backend code these days. This is why I decided to create my own theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-philosophy&#34;&gt;Design Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It needed to be clean and simple. Nothing too crazy, the page should load fast and the user should instantaneously know where to look naturally. No bright colours, no flashy hero-image background, no &lt;a href=&#34;http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;13 megabyte parallax-ative home page”&lt;/a&gt;, no nothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This philosophy also extends to the code, the markup should be clear and easy to understand (although the indentation can look a little weird sometimes - this is just an unfortunate artefact of some static site generators), and the CSS should be fairly lean. You could say I was inspired by this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/&#34;&gt;masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;, although I didn’t quite manage seven declarations. As I’ve said, I’m not much of a front end guy. I want to become better at it, this is why I have experimented with the CSS a little more than maybe I should have. If you do happen to be a designer and you are checking out my theme / code / CSS, do feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dilworth.jonathon@gmail.com&#34;&gt;drop me some constructive criticism&lt;/a&gt;, I would appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that some of the base CSS has been lifted from (here)[&lt;a href=&#34;http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/&#34;&gt;http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/&lt;/a&gt;]. I have credited the author in the code and have provided a reference on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jonathondilworth/sofya&#34;&gt;this projects GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;. Credit where credit is due.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &amp;lsquo;Content here, content here&amp;rsquo;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &amp;lsquo;lorem ipsum&amp;rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&lt;/p&gt;
