  <h2><a href="/post/sofya/" title="Sofya: a Blogging Theme for Hugo">Sofya: a Blogging Theme for Hugo</a></h2>
  

<p>The name Sofya is the Russian form of the Greek Sophia, meaning wisdom. It seemed like an apt name for a blogging theme.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Having browsed through a bunch of different themes that were available for free online, I failed to find one that encompassed all of the design elements that I wanted. In addition, I had been meaning to start a little bit more design-orientated work in my free time as I spend most of my time working on backend code these days. This is why I decided to create my own theme.</p>

<h2 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>It needed to be clean and simple. Nothing too crazy, the page should load fast and the user should instantaneously know where to look naturally. No bright colours, no flashy hero-image background, no <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">&ldquo;13 megabyte parallax-ative home page”</a>, no nothing!</p>

<p>This philosophy also extends to the code, the markup should be clear and easy to understand (although the indentation can look a little weird sometimes - this is just an unfortunate artefact of some static site generators), and the CSS should be fairly lean. You could say I was inspired by this <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">masterpiece</a>, although I didn’t quite manage seven declarations. As I’ve said, I’m not much of a front end guy. I want to become better at it, this is why I have experimented with the CSS a little more than maybe I should have. If you do happen to be a designer and you are checking out my theme / code / CSS, do feel free to <a href="mailto:dilworth.jonathon@gmail.com">drop me some constructive criticism</a>, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Please note that some of the base CSS has been lifted from (here)[<a href="http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/">http://hbpasti.github.io/heather-hugo/</a>]. I have credited the author in the code and have provided a reference on <a href="https://github.com/jonathondilworth/sofya">this projects GitHub page</a>. Credit where credit is due.</p>
